"Catalog number of the asteroid","Asteroid Name","UT date of observation","Time of the observation, in fractional days from start of UT date","The filter used for the observation. The list of filters with their approximate wavelengths in microns is given here: N  - 0.333; U  - 0.362; B  - 0.435; G  - 0.518; V  - 0.559; O  - 0.645; R  - 0.685; R1 - 0.685; R2 - 0.883; I  - 0.952; If the value is a number, it represents the central wavelenth of the bandpass in microns.","The phase angle of the asteroid is the angle between the asteroid-sun vectory and the asteroid-observer vector.","Degree of polarization, if given","RMS error in POLARIZATION","Polarization position angle","RMS error in POL_POS_ANGLE","Proper Coordinate Polarization. Degree of polarization in the proper coordinate system counted off from the perpendicular to the scattering plane: P(r) = P cos 2Q(r), where Q(r) is the position angle in the proper coordinate system, tabulated in the next field.","The angle between the measured direction of the strongest electric vector and the normal to the sun-asteroid-earth plane","Scattering Plane Position Angle - the position angle of the scattering plane","The observatory where the observation was made. The locations of the observatories are given in the accompanying document file 'polobs.asc'.","Identification of the paper in which the observation was published, consisting of a publication year (followed by a, b, or c in the case of multiple papers published by the same authors in a given year) and the first author of the paper. The complete citations of the papers can be found in the accompanying document 'apdrefs.asc'. In the case of unpublished observations the value of this field contains 'Unpubl.'."
